[Magic Memory](https://magic-memory-29443.firebaseapp.com/index.html) is a javascript web app that I created for Magic: the Gathering players. Essentially, it is a flash card style memory builder. It pulls from the [Magic: the Gathering API](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/) in order to fetch the information. For the scope of this project and it's deadline, I only incorporated one set of cards to demonstrate API fetch calls and DOM manipulation.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Future Implementations

Future implementations will include:
- Every Magic: the Gathering Card set
- Trivia based questions where users can input the answer to a form
- Built in a front end framework, either Vue or React

## Challenges

- General asynchronous Javscript issues.
